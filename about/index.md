# About Me
Hi there! My name's Luke. Pleasure to meet you.

I'm an engineer with a focus in robotics, machine learning, embedded systems, and software engineering. Currently, I'm working for Marble Technologies, and in the past I've worked for Blue River Technology, Don't Panic Labs, and a number of other companies. In addition to my engineering work I also try to create various forms of art, and also enjoy music, golf and biking. I'm currently pursuing a bachelors in Computer Science with minors in math and business at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, where I'm part of the [Raikes School](https://raikes.unl.edu).

On this website you'll find an incomplete directory of my engineering and artistic work, as well as ramblings about whatever happens to cross my mind. Welcome, and please enjoy your stay!
