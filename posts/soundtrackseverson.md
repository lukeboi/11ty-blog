Soundtracks for the Present Future is an art installation created by Charley Friedman. I've worked closely with Charley for the past five years as exhibition engineer. After a showing in Summer 2021 at the Bemis Center in Omaha, NE, the installation is now on display at [The Everson](https://everson.org/explore/current-exhibitions/charley-friedman-soundtracks-for-the-present-future/) in Syracuse, NY! It'll be at The Everson until April 10th, 2022.

Above is a video of the piece playing a Philip Glass piece, performed by Paul Barnes. We took lots of pictures/video, more videos like this will be posted soonâ„¢!
