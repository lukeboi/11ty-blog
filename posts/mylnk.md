MyLink (formerly MyLNK) is an app and website that serves as a database of all charitable organizations in Lincoln, NE. Itâ€™s a free app available on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mylnk/id1336646522) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.leadershiplincoln.mylnk&hl=en_US), as well as a [website](https://mylnk.app/home).

During my 3 summers as an intern at Don't Panic Labs, I worked on a small intern team tasked with the design, development and deployment of the project. I've played a leading role on every aspect of the project, including programming, UI and logo design, deployment and presenting the project to potential users. We built the app using Angular and NativeScript. The database backend is made with Firebase. The website (and private administration panel) were also built using Angular.

We published the app in early 2018 and began rolling out the website in 2019. As of this writing (2020), the app has over 13,000 downloads and  over 2,000 monthly active users. The app and website is used extensively by first responders, teachers and case workers throughout Lincoln, NE. The project has received extensive recognition from local press as well as several awards for it's impact.

2021 update: The project has rebranded to MyLink and has expanded into the Sarpy County, Sandhills and Central (Kearney) regions of Nebraska!
